## **About**

MLSecOps Labs™ is a technical organization dedicated to advancing the security of machine-learning systems through **evidence-driven engineering**, **reproducible experiments**, and **operational guidance**.

We maintain a private lab where every pattern, module, lesson, and failure mode is first tested in realistic environments. Mature insights then flow into:

- **The MLSecOps Field Manual™** — an evolving guide to securing ML systems  
- **MLSecOps Modules** — runnable demonstrations of attacks, defenses, monitoring patterns, and architectural practices  
- **Research Artifacts & Tools** — reference implementations, hardened configurations, and supporting code  

Our work is grounded in security engineering discipline, shaped by real systems, and focused on practical impact.

## **Mission**

To provide **reproducible, operational clarity** in securing machine-learning systems:

- Understand the true behavior of ML in real infrastructure  
- Document failure modes, misconfigurations, and unexpected behavior  
- Build concrete, runnable examples of both attack and defense  
- Translate field experience into navigable, open knowledge  
- Support practitioners, defenders, and builders alike

## **AI-Assisted Engineering Disclosure**

This project was developed using a **hybrid workflow** that combines:

* Human-driven engineering
* AI-assisted drafting, coding, review, and research
* Manual validation, correction, and iteration by the author

AI tools were used as **assistants**, not autonomous agents.
All infrastructure, configurations, testing, integrations, and final decisions were performed by the author in a **hands-on, human-led manner**.

The goals for AI-assisted development were:
* Accelerating experimentation
* Exploring multiple design/attack/defense patterns
* Reducing boilerplate work
* Improving clarity and documentation
* Learning through guided iteration

Every module, configuration, and implementation was manually validated and reproduced to ensure understanding, accuracy, and transparency.
