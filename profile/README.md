## About This Work

All content is developed through systematic experimentation in a private MLSecOps lab. Each module is tested, validated, and documented before publication.

Work follows these principles:
- Lean, reproducible, fact-driven
- Lab-validated before publishing
- Evidence-based, no hype

---

## AI-Assisted Development

This project uses AI tools for:
- Drafting and documentation review
- Code assistance and troubleshooting
- Research and learning support

All infrastructure, experiments, and final decisions are human-led. Every module is manually validated and reproduced to ensure accuracy.
